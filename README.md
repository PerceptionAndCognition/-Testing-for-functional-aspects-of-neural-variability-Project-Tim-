# -Testing-for-functional-aspects-of-neural-variability-Project-Tim-
Code that was used for the Research Project "Testing for functional aspects of neural variability" and to investigate the ITV- Tim 
I preprocessed the data and loaded the data files using 'Load_Data'- because of memory errors the 18 files were loaded in pairs of six and pickled. 
"Programm_Done" was used to analyse the data --> I tried to comment it out so anyone can understand what I did. Contact me if you have questions.
  --> For the research project, only the normal ERP plots (with baseline correction and without CV correction), the ITV plots (without baseline correction and without CV correction) 
      and the coefficient of varriation analysis of the P200 and P100 peaks for the ambiguous conditions just like the early peak (FWHM) for the noise condition (all with baseline correction and without CV correction) were used. 
  --> The peak finding and FWHM needs to be further pursued. 
  --> "Quenching" and "Time-Frequency analysis" were not realized completely for the research project- however, the used definitions are from Lukas Hecker and are correct (as far as I`m instructed) 
 
"Definitions" contains all the Definitions that were used in order to analyse the data. I also tried to comment it out what the definitions do and how they work. 

--> Thanks to Lukas who helped me a lot writing all the code (most definitions are from him actually)
